	abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and refraction seismics are among the most frequently used geophysical methods for site-investigations and the combined results can be very helpful to fill in the gaps between the point measurements made by traditional geotechnical methods such as Cone Penetration Test (CPT), core-drilling and geophysical borehole logging. The interpretation of the results from a geophysical investigation constituting a single method often yields ambiguous results. Hence, an approach utilizing multiple techniques is often necessary. To facilitate interpretation of such a combined dataset, we propose a more controlled and objective approach and present a method for a structurally coupled inversion of 2D electrical resistivity and refraction seismic data using unstructured meshes. Mean shift clustering is used to combine the two images and to compare the separate and coupled inversion methodologies. Two synthetic examples are used to demonstrate the method, and a field-data example is included as a proof of concept. In all cases a significant improvement by the coupling is visible. The methodology can be used as a tool for improved data interpretation and for obtaining a more comprehensive and complete picture of the subsurface by combining geophysical methods.}

	abstract = {The development and use of open-source software in geophysics over the last decade have grown considerably. However, there are few open-software alternatives for seismic methods and even fewer regarding seismic refraction data processing and inversion. We present Refrapy, an open-source package for seismic refraction data analysis written in Python, using some of the main libraries for scientific computing and geosciences. Divided into two main programs (Refrapick and Refrainv), it is possible to perform basic waveform processing, picking of first breaks, and inversion through time-terms analysis or traveltimes tomography, all with GUIs interaction. To evaluate and validate the products obtained using Refrapy, we analyzed sets of synthetic data and real field data. The calculated models recovered the geometry and velocities values of the actual synthetic models satisfactorily. The joint interpretation of the results obtained with both available inversion techniques permitted a more detailed interpretation. As for the analysis of real data, the results presented a compatible response compared to the model obtained by a well-established commercial software, satisfactorily representing the geological context interpreted initially. The software presented in this work is expected to contribute to the activities of researchers, practitioners, and students regarding the analysis of seismic refraction data as a free, open, and user-friendly alternative.}
